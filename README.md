Load your 3D model easily in a Three.js scene and enjoy Showroom mode.

## Usage

Enjoy [live demo](https://sboez.github.io/3D-Models-Load/) or type `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` in your terminal and go to your favorite browser Firefox :wink:

## Compatible formats

**.STL .DAE .FBX .GLTF .GLB**

## Textures

Only FBX and GLB files can show you the model with a texture. 
Others needed to add texture manually, that's why I added a grey color by default. But you can still change the path of the texture in the code, follow the procedure explained in the comments.

## Work in progress...

###### I'm using Blender to export my FBX file to a GLB. To add a texture on your FBX model with Blender, you need to check *copy* in *Path Mode* during export.
